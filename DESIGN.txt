Genre:
	I wanted to try a Multiway Scroller (kind of how like agar.io is) but I am not sure how I would implement that yet; so the current plan is just a Top Down Scrolling Shooter, but if I have time I want to try switching that to the Multiway Scroller if possible.
Name:
	"Wanna Pizza Me?"
Back Story:
	You were very hungry after a day at Shooters, so you ask your roommate, the chemistry major, to make you a giant pizza. However, instead of creating a giant pizza, your roommate has created multiple mutant pizzas. Now you and your roommate must capture all the escaped pizzas before everyone wakes up.  
Goal:
	The goal is to catch all the pizza boxes by throwing pizza boxes at them.
	The player will advance to the next level if they catch all the pizzas.
	The game is won when the boss pizza is defeated.
	The game ends when time is up, or when the player runs out of lives.
Game Play:
	X to shoot pizza boxes
	Arrow Keys to move
Different levels:
	One level is just going to capture small mutant pizzas, and the other level will have a bigger "boss pizza" that spawns baby pizzas.
