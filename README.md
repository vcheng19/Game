# game
First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2016

Name: Virginia Cheng

Date started: 20 January 2016

Date finished: 23 January 2016

Hours worked: 36ish

Resources used: the ExampleGame from Prof. Duvall, docs.oracle, Spongebob pictures

Main class file: Main.java

Data (non Java) files needed: angrySponge.png, background.png, boss.png, gameover.png, hearts.png, nextlevel.png, pizza.png, pizzabox.png, spongebob1.png, start.png, win.png

How to play the game:
- X to shoot, arrow keys to move
- You move onto the next level when all the little pizzas are caught
- You win the game when you beat the boss.
- Game Over when you either run out of lives or run out of time.
- You cannot shoot when you've just been hit or if you are currently shooting.

Keys/Mouse input: X to shoot, arrow keys to move

Cheat Keys: P for immunity (only lasts a few seconds), O to restore lives, N is an auto gameover, L skips to boss level 

Known bugs: Sometimes the pizza box does not disappear (but I think that might just be a glitch in java).

Extra features:

Impressions/Suggestions: In the future, I would like to include a restart button so that you can restart rather than having to close the game and reopen it everytime. I would also like to make the players movement smoother and make it so the user could see which way the player was facing (like how pokemon and zelda work); as well as making it so the pizzas could drop power ups such as coins or hearts.
