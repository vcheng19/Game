First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2016

Name: Virginia Cheng

Date started: 20 January 2016

Date finished: 23 January 2016

Hours worked: 36ish

Resources used: the ExampleGame from Prof. Duvall, docs.oracle, Spongebob pictures

Main class file: Main.java

Data (non Java) files needed: angrySponge.png, background.png, boss.png, gameover.png, hearts.png, nextlevel.png, pizza.png, pizzabox.png, spongebob1.png, start.png, win.png

How to play the game: X to shoot, arrow keys to move
		      You move onto the next level when all the little pizzas are caught
		      You win the game when you beat the boss.
		      Game Over when you either run out of lives or run out of time.
		      You cannot shoot when you've just been hit or if you are currently shooting.

Keys/Mouse input: X to shoot, arrow keys to move

Cheat Keys: P for immunity (only lasts a few seconds), O to restore lives, N is an auto gameover, L skips to boss level 

Known bugs: Sometimes the pizza box does not disappear (but I think that might just be a glitch in java).

Extra features:

Impressions/Suggestions: I thought the project was interesting; however, I wish javafx had like a Camera that shows the player only part of the screen.
